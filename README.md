# Terraform notes:

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is a HashiCorp tool that is cloud-agnostic, which means you can use the same logic to deploy resources across multiple clouds, including AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Why Terraform?

Terraform offers greater flexibility and multi-cloud support compared to cloud-native tools like CloudFormation (CFT) and Azure Resource Manager (ARM). It simplifies resource management through modules, reusable code, and a powerful state management system.

### Key Differences between CNT (CFT, ARM) & Terraform:

| Feature                          | CFT & ARM                           | Terraform                      |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Language                          | JSON or YAML (All configs in one file) | HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) |
| Complexity                        | Learning JSON/YAML is difficult       | HCL is simpler and modular     |
| Cloud Compatibility               | AWS (CFT), Azure (ARM) only          | Multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)  |
| Module Support                    | No                                  | Yes, with reusable modules     |
| Workspace Support                 | No                                  | Yes, supports multiple workspaces |
| Dry-Run Capability                | Limited                             | `terraform plan` for effective dry-run |
| Importing Resources               | Complex in AWS, not available in ARM | Simple with `terraform import` |

## Data sources:

Data sources in Terraform is used to fetch information about existing resources, such as VPC IDs, subnet IDs, security group IDs, etc. Once you retrieve this information, you can use it in your Terraform configurations to create or manage other resources.

### Example:
Fetching AZ'S using data source and creating subnets in that AZ
``` 
data "aws_availability_zones" "available_zones" {
  state = "available"
}

#public subnets 
resource "aws_subnet" "pubsubnet1a" {
    vpc_id     = aws_vpc.myvpc.id
    availability_zone = data.aws_availability_zones.available_zones.names[0]
    cidr_block = var.pubsub1a_cidr_block
    map_public_ip_on_launch = true



  tags = {
    Name = "pubsubnet_us_east_1a"
  }
}
```
