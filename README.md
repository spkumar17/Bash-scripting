# Terraform notes:

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is a HashiCorp tool that is cloud-agnostic, which means you can use the same logic to deploy resources across multiple clouds, including AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Why Terraform?

Terraform offers greater flexibility and multi-cloud support compared to cloud-native tools like CloudFormation (CFT) and Azure Resource Manager (ARM). It simplifies resource management through modules, reusable code, and a powerful state management system.

### Key Differences between CNT (CFT, ARM) & Terraform:

| Feature                          | CFT & ARM                           | Terraform                      |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Language                          | JSON or YAML (All configs in one file) | HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) |
| Complexity                        | Learning JSON/YAML is difficult       | HCL is simpler and modular     |
| Cloud Compatibility               | AWS (CFT), Azure (ARM) only          | Multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)  |
| Module Support                    | No                                  | Yes, with reusable modules     |
| Workspace Support                 | No                                  | Yes, supports multiple workspaces |
| Dry-Run Capability                | Limited                             | `terraform plan` for effective dry-run |
| Importing Resources               | Complex in AWS, not available in ARM | Simple with `terraform import` |
