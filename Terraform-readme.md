#Terraform notes:

##What is Terraform?

Terraform is a HashiCorp tool that is cloud-agnostic, which means you can use the same logic to deploy resources across multiple clouds, including AWS, Azure, and GCP.

##Why Terraform?

Terraform offers greater flexibility and multi-cloud support compared to cloud-native tools like CloudFormation (CFT) and Azure Resource Manager (ARM). It simplifies resource management through modules, reusable code, and a powerful state management system.
