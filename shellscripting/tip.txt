Digits: Each digit can be a number from 0 to 7.
Positions: The three positions represent:
1st Digit: Permissions for the owner of the file.
2nd Digit: Permissions for the group that the file belongs to.
3rd Digit: Permissions for others (everyone else).

Each digit is the sum of its corresponding permission values:

Read (r): 4
Write (w): 2
Execute (x): 1

Examples
7: (4 + 2 + 1) = Read, Write, and Execute
6: (4 + 2 + 0) = Read and Write
5: (4 + 0 + 1) = Read and Execute
4: (4 + 0 + 0) = Read only
3: (2 + 1 + 0) = Write and Execute
2: (2 + 0 + 0) = Write only
1: (0 + 0 + 1) = Execute only
0: No permissions
Examples of chmod
chmod 777 file:

Owner: Read, Write, Execute (7)
Group: Read, Write, Execute (7)
Others: Read, Write, Execute (7)
chmod 700 file:

Owner: Read, Write, Execute (7)
Group: No permissions (0)
Others: No permissions (0)

Summary
chmod 777 grants full permissions to everyone.
chmod 700 gives full permissions only to the owner, restricting access to others.
