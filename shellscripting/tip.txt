Digits: Each digit can be a number from 0 to 7.
Positions: The three positions represent:
1st Digit: Permissions for the owner of the file.
2nd Digit: Permissions for the group that the file belongs to.
3rd Digit: Permissions for others (everyone else).

Each digit is the sum of its corresponding permission values:

Read (r): 4
Write (w): 2
Execute (x): 1

Examples
7: (4 + 2 + 1) = Read, Write, and Execute
6: (4 + 2 + 0) = Read and Write
5: (4 + 0 + 1) = Read and Execute
4: (4 + 0 + 0) = Read only
3: (2 + 1 + 0) = Write and Execute
2: (2 + 0 + 0) = Write only
1: (0 + 0 + 1) = Execute only
0: No permissions
Examples of chmod
chmod 777 file:

Owner: Read, Write, Execute (7)
Group: Read, Write, Execute (7)
Others: Read, Write, Execute (7)
chmod 700 file:

Owner: Read, Write, Execute (7)
Group: No permissions (0)
Others: No permissions (0)

Summary
chmod 777 grants full permissions to everyone.
chmod 700 gives full permissions only to the owner, restricting access to others.

Numeric Comparison Operators
Here are some common numeric comparison operators in shell scripting:

-eq: Checks if two numbers are equal.
-ne: Checks if two numbers are not equal.
-gt: Checks if one number is greater than another.
-lt: Checks if one number is less than another.
-ge: Checks if one number is greater than or equal to another.
-le: Checks if one number is less than or equal to another.
String Comparison
For string comparisons, you should use the following operators:

=: Checks if two strings are equal.
!=: Checks if two strings are not equal.
<: Checks if one string is less than another (lexicographically).
>: Checks if one string is greater than another (lexicographically).
==: Checks if two strings are equal (works in [[ ... ]] but can also be used in [ ... ] with some shells).
